## Running the project for development

```
yarn run dev
```

## TODO List:
* Implement a Packager
* Stat.ink integration
* Sorting on Tables
* Open Splatnet 2 in webview
* Invalidate Session Token on login error
* look into how to use babel on backend process (low priority)
* Schedule Page
* Get other language users to test
* Better opening screen.  (login.js).

## Development
Note: Render Process is using babel, but the backend process is not so allowed syntax between the two is different right now.
